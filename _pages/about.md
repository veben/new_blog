I possess extensive knowledge and hands-on experience with a wide array of technologies, including cloud computing, Java and Python development, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, serverless architecture, microservices, and containers. This expertise enables me to effectively navigate complex technical landscapes.

I currently work for a fast-growing company where I engage with major corporations, including Global 500 and CAC40 companies. As a Technical Presales professional, I demonstrate the technical strengths of our solution in critical areas such as security, performance, flexibility, and availability.

I thrive in challenging environments and enjoy learning new technologies and tools. As a servant leader, I value a collaborative and supportive work environment, teamwork and mutual growth.
