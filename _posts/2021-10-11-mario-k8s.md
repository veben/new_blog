Are you a fan of classic video games and looking to deploy a fun project using Kubernetes? This post will walk you through deploying a Mario Bros on a Kuberntes cluster.

The associated code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/veben/aws_tf_eks_mario)

## Prerequisites
Before you proceed, ensure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster. If you don't have one set up yet, you can follow our previous [post](https://veben.github.io/tf-aws-eks/) to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS using Terraform.

## Components Overview

### 1. Deployment
The deployment manages the Mario Bros application instances:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mario-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2  # You can adjust the number of replicas as needed
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mario
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mario
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mario-container
        image: sevenajay/mario:latest 
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This configuration sets up **2** replicas, meaning there will be two different pods running the game. The containers expose port **80**.

### 2. Service
The service exposes the Mario Bros application to external traffic:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mario-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: mario
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

This service is of type **LoadBalancer** and maps the container's port 80 to external traffic on port 80.

## Deploying the game
To deploy the game, apply the necessary Kubernetes manifests:
```sh
cd k8s_mario
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

Verify that the deployment was successful and all components are running:
```sh
kubectl get all
```

## Testing the game
Once the deployment is complete, retrieve the LoadBalancer Ingress URL:
```sh
kubectl describe service mario-service
```

Copy and paste the URL into your browser to access the game. Get ready for some nostalgic gaming fun!

## Cleaning up
After enjoying the game, clean up the resources by deleting the deployment and service:
```sh
kubectl delete service mario-service
kubectl delete deployment mario-deployment
```

With this, you've successfully deployed and enjoyed a classic game on your Kubernetes cluster. Until next time, happy gaming!
